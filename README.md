# AI-powered automobile parking system
The AI-powered automobile parking system is designed to automate and improve the process of detecting parking spaces and determining occupancy status using OpenCV. The system analyses video input and makes real-time predictions regarding parking spot availability using computer vision techniques. This technology aims to optimize parking space utilization, minimize congestion, and enhance the overall parking experience.

# Features
Real-time detection of vacant and occupied parking spaces
Responsive user-friendly web interface for viewing available slots
Integration with live video feeds for dynamic slot allocation
Scalability to accommodate various parking environments such as lots, garages, and on-street parking
High detection accuracy using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques

# Acknowledgements
OpenCV for providing the computer vision tools
Flask for the web framework
